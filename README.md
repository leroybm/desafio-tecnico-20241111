# Desafio TÃ©cnico - Frontend

To run the project just run `docker compose up`

Alternatively, open the BACK and the FRONT with the correct node (see .nvmrc), and run `npm install`, then

FRONT: `npm start`
BACK: `npm run dev`

## What was delivered

Almost all requirements (What is missing is the markdown editing)

## What I missed due to timing

- Making proper comments in the code
- Adding tests
- Paying more attention to accessibility (Kanban's are notoriously difficult to handle in that)
- Applying i18n (Should be pretty straight forward in Angular)
- Making sure the project runs well in multiple screen sizes
- Moving between lists using drag and drop 
  - This was in progress
- A better login screen
